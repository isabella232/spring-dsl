== ANTLR
As many languages are parsed and lexed using _ANTLR_ we try to provide
integration support so that your path to use _ANTLR_ would be as easy
as possible. Realistically this means that we try to be relatively
conservative what comes from _ANTLR_ by providing base implementations
to other parts of the _Spring DSL_.

Two major areas _Spring DSL_ can help with integration into _ANTLR_ is
_reconciliation_ and _code completion_ which usually are first things
a language developer needs to tackle.
