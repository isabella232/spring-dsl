=== Language Id
_LSP_ itself defines a set or languages it knows natively. We thought it would be a
good idea to have an abstraction over `LanguageId` class. _Spring Dsl_ have mappings
for all languages defined in _LSP_ itself, but if you want to have your own, just
defined it like:

First time one is about to use `LanguageId` is with <<dsl-core-dslservice>>.

`LanguageId` also have a method `isCompatibleWith(LanguageId other)` which allows
to check if one language support other type of languages.

[TIP]
====
`LanguageId.ALL` supports all languages and can be used in services which
want to support everything. For example `DefaultReconciler` which is dispatching
to all linters, naturally support all languages.
