[NOTE]
====
Bear in mind that we're just throwing out concepts like `Document` and `ReconcileProblem`.
We need to get started from one concept until we get to next one and then glue all
these together.
====

Other interface for _reconciliation_ is a _Reconciler_ which is similar than _Linter_
but works on a LSP's `PublishDiagnosticsParams`. Together these two interfaces allow
flexible ways to choose how different documents are reconciled.
