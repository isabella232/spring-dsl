=== LSP Domain Classes
LSP itself have a set of domain classes defining a contract in a JSONRPC json structures.
While some of these classes are only useful with an actual integration between IDE and
a Language Server, some classes are generally useful as a generic way to pass information
between components.

All these domain classes are kept in a _Spring Dsl_ core and generally contain _Builder_
and other convenience methods to construct instances of these classes. For example below
we create an instances of a `Position` class.
