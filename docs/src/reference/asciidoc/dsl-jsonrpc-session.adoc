=== Session
`JsonRpcSession` can be used to store variables and other information between requests until
particular session is kept alive. If you've ever used `WebSession` from a _WebFlux`, this
concept is very similar.

To access `JsonRpcSession` in a controller methods, simply add is as an parameter and
a framework will call method with associated session. In a below example session id is
simple returned as a mono.
