== Spring Boot Auto Configuration
_Spring Dsl_ is currently not managed by a _Spring Boot_, thus we have our
own `Auto-Configuration` module. `Auto-Configuration` greatly simplifies
cases where _Language Services_ needs to be created.

As _Language Server_ is usually used in different connection configurations,
`spring.dsl.lsp.server.mode` can have values `PROCESS`, `SOCKET` or
`WEBSOCKET`. Process mode simply uses standard input/output, socket mode
a configured native socket and a websocket mode assumes websocket via webflux
is available.
