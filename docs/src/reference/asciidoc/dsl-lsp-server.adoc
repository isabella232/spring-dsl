=== Language Server
This section describes how a _Language Server_ is created using _Spring Dsl_.

==== With Language Services
If you rely solely on services from <<dsl-core>> there is not that much you
need to understand about _LSP_ itself.

There are two server related controllers, `RootLanguageServerController`
and `TextDocumentLanguageServerController` providing basis of a shared
functionality for _Language Servers_.
