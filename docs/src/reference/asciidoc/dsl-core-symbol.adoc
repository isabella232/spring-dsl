_Symbol_ is a relatively loose concept in terms of a `Document` reconciliation
or checking, what can be said is that with `Symbol` information you can identify
centain parts of a `Document` which most likely are interested when _LSP_
is used with an real _IDE_. Well that was a mouthful, so lets go through what is
a _Symbol_. In _Spring Lsp_ we are basing this interface as a
`DocumentSymbol` which is a base defining various _LSP_ properties about
a _Symbol_ itself.

There is more detailed chapter about generic use of a _Symboltable_
in a <<dsl-symboltable>>.
