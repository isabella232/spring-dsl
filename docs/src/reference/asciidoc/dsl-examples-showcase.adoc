== Showcase
_Showcase_ is a sample module not adding any new language
definitions, but instead using languages from <<dsl-examples-simple>>,
<<dsl-examples-wordcheck>> and <<dsl-examples-dot>> and
adding some other additional features for interactions between
a client and a server.

We define a new `Hoverer` which simply gives a hardcoded hover. For
this sample this is mostly done because wordcheck sample doesn't have
`Hoverer` of its own.
