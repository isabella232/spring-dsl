== LSP
Traditionally a _Language Server_ and a _Language Client_ implementations
are just arbitry components following a contract defined in a <<glossary-lsp, LSP>>
protocol. While you are free to implement everything from scratch by just
handling _JSONRPC_ traffic between client and server, this is usually rather
tedious process as you need to get very deep understanding how _LSP_ actually
works. We think that integrating a more higher level services described in
<<dsl-core>> into a generic controllers handling _LSP_ traffic is much more
user friendly way to implement language services.
